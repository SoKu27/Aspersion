# Aspersion
This website was created for Busneiss Professionals of America(BPA), my team and I competed in the category of visual team design. Our team was reponsible for making promotional content for a movie, so we created a movie poster, character posters, a DVD case, a trailer, a merch store, an instagram, and most importantly a website. My main responsibility was the website. The backend of the website consists of python, where I utilized the web framework of Flask. The frontend is where I spent most of my time and I used HTML and CSS. I beileve that this website played a significant part in my group's immense success in our endevor this year at BPA. We placed 1st place at the regions, 3rd place at state, and 10th in nationals.
